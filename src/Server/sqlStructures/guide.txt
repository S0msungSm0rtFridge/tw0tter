mysql -u root -p
SELECT CURRENT_USER();
SHOW DATABASES;
USE "name of database";
exit;

when making database
host is localhost
user should be root
password is password
database name is tw0tter
(This is the credentials I used to create the connection with the database)

run the sql files in the order
users -> communities -> posts -> replies -> dummy-data

mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < users.sql
